# "Hello, World!"
Welcome to my personal blog! Who am I? Briefly put, I’m an engineering student interested in technology, fitness and learning. I’m creating this blog to journal my thoughts across these interest areas and any other random topics I may find noteworthy.

On the off chance that you choose to keep up with this blog, you can expect to see an odd mix of write-ups about my fitness training and reflections on my progress, brief summaries of books or articles I have read, and random musings I have as an engineer at heart.

If you like something you see here (or don’t, I suppose), definitely shoot me an email at **<code>me@baranusluel.com</code>** and let me know what you think. In fact, I *challenge* you to – let’s see who’ll be the first to write.
