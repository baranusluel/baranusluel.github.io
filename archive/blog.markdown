# "Hello, World!"
Welcome to my personal blog! I’m a software engineer interested in technology, fitness and exploring new things. I’m creating this blog to journal my thoughts across these and other noteworthy topics.

If you choose to keep up with this blog, you can expect to see an odd mix of write-ups about my fitness training and reflections on my progress, brief summaries of books or articles I have read (follow what I'm reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/baranusluel)), and random musings I have as an engineer at heart.

If you like something you see here (or don’t, I suppose), feel free to shoot me an email at **<code>me@baranusluel.com</code>**!
